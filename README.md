# Advent of Code 2023 üéÑ

This repositry serves as my collection of answers written in typescript.

The project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as runtime.

## Structure

The solvings are placed in the `/days` folder where each day has it's own folder. Each day has it's own test, and utils file to abstract logic.

## Tests

All of the examples for each day has written test case in the respective `index.test.ts` file for the day.

When the day is solved, a test for the correct result is added.

To run the tests:

```bash
$ bun test
```

## Notes

Below are my notes on how it went for the individual days. It's honest and initial thoughts.

| Day | Name                            | Stars | Execution time | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 01  | Trebuchet                       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | 2.36ms         | Part two was difficult to solve, due to the fact, that the first number should be found left-to-right but the last number right-to-left. E.g. `eightwoeightwo` is equal to `82`. I started by replacing by it's occurance index, wich gave me `8wo8wo`, but it should have been `8weeigh2`. So on the last number, the last occurence wins vs. the first occurance where the first character. <br><br>The way i ended up solving it, was to pre-/sufix the number with the word to make sure not to break a words. that gave me: `eight8eightow2twoeight8eightwo2two`. Then a simple regex `/[^\d]/ig` to only get the numbers worked like a charm `8282` => `82`.                                                                                                                    |
| 02  | Cube Conundrum                  | ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | 4.08ms         | I found these parts to fairly easy compared to day 1. I quickly created a parser to make the game data into an object format which helped me a lot in the 2nd part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 03  | Gear Ratios                     | ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | 9.43ms         | What a mess! I really struggled with this. I spent hours on what I now think was overcomplicating it. I struggled mostly with the second part. For some reason, I just couldn't wrap my head around it. Seeing on the leaderboard that people had solved it in 15 minutes was definitely demotivating üòÖ. What I ended up struggling the most with was numbers on the same line like `422.729`. Since the adjacency could be diagonal, it ended up becoming one large number instead of two separate ones. I solved it a bit messily. I think I would have used a regular expression to test if it was a line with two numbers if I were to refactor it.                                                                                                                              |
| 04  | Scratchcards                    | ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | 459.31ms       | Compared to yesterday this was fairly easy. I did struggle a bit with part two, and ended up brute-forcing the result. Wich is evident in the execution time (slow üêå). I Used a Class this time to encaptulate the logic with the entity. That helped me a lot in yet another looping-hell. (Edit;) I add some caching of the pointable numbers and copies to speed up the task. Furthermore i made a index map of the original cards to be able to lookup direcly in the map for the card index instead of the find method. This changede the execution speed from around ~7700ms to ~475ms (~94% speed improvement). See the original implementation [45cf53f](https://github.com/tkjaergaard/advent-of-code-2023/blob/45cf53f59fe7311eada549078fe050b50c9bd8b2/days/04/utils.ts). |
| 05  | If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer | ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | 1.64ms         | Wauw, i quickly got part one but really struggeled with part two. As previously, my code wasn't made for handling that large ranges and list of inputs. I ended up rewriting the whole algorithm into a function that could handle both parts using the ranges approach. Felt this could have been done more elegantly - but maybe not more efficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 06  | Wait For It                     | ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | 228.00ms       | I fairly quickly got both parts of today. As soon as i figured out the alogrithm, is was easy to calculate the answers. The second parts is a bit slow to execute (~210ms), but it gets the job done. There are property some optimizations to be done here for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
